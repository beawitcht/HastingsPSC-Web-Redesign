                <p><p>The much-anticipated trial of three local men for their part in a peaceful protest outside an arms factory in Hastings back in February was delayed today until 2025.</p>
<p>Retired train driver Laurie Holden, 71, NHS worker Clem McCullough, 33, and artist Thomas Delves, 24, were due to plead not guilty to the charge of aggravated trespass at Hastings Magistrates Court today in a one-day hearing.</p>
<p>The charge, which carries a maximum tariff of a three-month in jail term and £2,500 fine, relates to a peaceful, community protest outside the General Dynamics factory site in Sidley Little Road on 29 February.</p>
<p>But before the trial could begin, counsel for the prosecution Mr Piers Restell appealed for an adjournment, saying he hadn't yet read the defense arguments, believed to include technical and legal points of human rights law.</p>
<p>Viviane Bablin from Hodge Jones and Allen solicitors, representing Mr Holden and Mr Delves, agreed to the prosecution request, adding the case would be better suited to a District Judge 'with experience of these issues.'</p>
<p>Magistrates Dr Rebekah Gilbert, Mr Clive Rosewell and Mr Anthony Biggs, allowed the adjournment and the case will now be heard in front of District Judge Amanda Kelly in Brighton on 22 January 2025 at 10am.</p>
<p>Dr Rebekah Gilbert said: 'There are issues on both sides here that need to be addressed.'</p>
<p>She added: 'Information should be served well in advance so we don't do this again!'</p>
<p>But Katy Colley, Chair of the Hastings &amp; District Palestine Solidarity Campaign (HDPSC), slammed the move as 'ridiculous' and 'unacceptable.'</p>
<p>'We can't quite believe the CPS continues to waste the time and expense of the courts with this ridiculous persecution of three peaceful individuals who have courageously stood up against the war machine in our hometown,' she said.</p>
<p>'The Hastings Three have not hurt a fly. They are principled people who have refused to stand idly by in the face of genocide and this vindictive and, frankly, pointless pursuit through the courts is an insult to us as taxpayers and as people of conscience.</p>
<p>'It is utterly unacceptable that this case has gone on as long as it has, let alone continuing this madness into next year.'</p>
<p>Ahead of the trial around 50 supporters of the #Hastings3 gathered at the steps of the court for a rally to 'show solidarity and demand an end to arm sales to Israel.'</p>
<p>Grace Lally, Twinning Officer of the HDPSC, warned the arbitrary repression of peaceful protestors in this country has ratcheted up in recent months in defense of Israel's assault in Gaza.</p>
<p>She described 'grotesque abuses of the law' by the British government to clamp down on peaceful resistance, using for the first time the Terrorism Act to detain Palestine Action protestors.</p>
<p>'This is peaceful, non-violent direct action against the companies that are arming the genocide by brave actionists in Palestine Action,' said Ms Lally.</p>
<p>'And they use the Terrorism Act to detain them, an Act allows them to be held for seven days without any charge, and extended to 14 days without any charge.'</p>
<p>The same act, she said, had recently been used against British journalist Richard Medhurst for 'speaking the truth about what is happening in Palestine.'</p>
<p>'This is a frightening extension of the horror that we're seeing in Palestine,' she said. 'And it's all part of the same system that allows this to continue.'</p>
<p>She said the pursuit of the Hastings Three was part of a pattern of legal harassment locally.</p>
<p>'And for what? Just for sitting on the ground in front of an arms factory arming genocide, for peacefully sitting down and say: 'Stop. Just stop. Stop sending weapons to a genocidal regime.' And it is them that were dragged away, put in a van, held for 14 hours in a police cell....Shame!</p>
<p>'And to go through this absolute farce for months and months, waiting, then a whole day in court, in trial today, for what crime? For the crime of a peacefully protesting genocide!'</p>
<p>Simon Hester of the Hastings and District Trades Union Council said: 'We're here in solidarity for the people of Palestine and especially the people of Gaza who face now 323 days of bombardment from land, sea and air, unremitting attacks by one of the world's most powerful armies carrying out a systematic and targeted slaughter of the civilian population.'</p>
<p>He said: 'Israel is a settler-colonial state, a racist, apartheid state that has been oppressing the Palestinians for decades.'</p>
<p>Mr Hester noted the solidarity movement in the UK was 'part of a new global movement in solidarity with the people of Palestine. Millions upon millions of people have marched across the world.'</p>
<p>He said Israel was 'getting away with the genocide' because it was 'backed to the hilt by the USA, the UK and the EU governments politically, diplomatically and militarily. And without direct Western military aid Israel would not be able to continue with the slaughter that's taking place.'</p>
<p>He said: 'We must ban all arms sales to Israel. And as the government cannot bring themselves to stop companies like General Dynamics from arming Israel, it's up to us, it's up to the people, it's up to the worldwide solidarity movement.</p>
<p>'We will continue our campaign to close down General Dynamics. We do not want a company complicit in and protecting profiting from genocide in our town.'</p>
<p>Afterwards, Clem McCullough and Laurie Holden thanked supporters on the steps of the court for coming out to show their solidarity.</p>
<p>'It means a lot to us to see so many people here today,' said Laurie. 'Solidarity is important. It means so much and it's really heartwarming.' </p></p>
